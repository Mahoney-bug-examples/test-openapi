# OpenAPI in IntelliJ with Kotlin project

Designed to show the issues using an openapi document in IntelliJ

* IntelliJ wrongly marks `val ref = "\$ref"` as an error "JSON standard does not allow such tokens"
* IntelliJ wrongly marks all `$ref` values as warning `Property 'SchemaName' not found`
* IntelliJ throws exceptions
* IntelliJ uses masses of CPU
